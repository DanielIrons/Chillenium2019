**About Game**
This game is a level based, collabrative, high speed, and chaotic experience with team work in mind as the main goal of the game. The game is about a group of the most important people in the world, the behind the band stage crew, working their butts off as a team to make sure that the audience and the band never notice they exist at allÂ¹. The game is about everyone working together as fast as possible to get the stage set for the bands big performance.

**About the Crew**
We are a group of friends who love to code and work together to make fun or funny projects. We have done a couple game jams together already, and are excited to show you what we've got this year. We are a combined group, half from UT Austin and half from Texas A&M.
