**About Game**
This game is a level based, collabrative, high speed, and chaotic experience with team work in mind as the main goal of the game. The game is about a group of the most important people in the world, the behind the band stage crew, working their butts off as a team to make sure that the audience and the band never notice they exist at allÂ¹. The game is about everyone working together as fast as possible to get the stage set for the bands big performance.

**About the Crew**
We are a group of friends who love to code and work together to make fun or funny projects. We have done a couple game jams together already, and are excited to show you what we've got this year. We are a combined group, half from UT Austin and half from Texas A&M.

**How to Play**
The name of the game is to stay on top of the work, you have to complete tasks given to you via a computer terminal in a timely fashion or the bands' show and will suffer. There are many interactable objects around the map, that the players must interact with at certain times to achieve behind the scenes musical success, these wil be discussed below.
